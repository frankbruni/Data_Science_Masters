# Spotify Visualizations: Understanding Music History Through Visual Data Storytelling

<h2>Group: Daphne Yang, Julie Lai, Frank Bruni, Arda Sozer</h2>

### Description

<hr>

<h2> Objective </h2>
<p>For this visualization, we wanted to create a way for users to interact with data and discover new insights about music popularity. </p>
<h3> Hypotheses </h3>
<p> We aim to explore 4 main hypotheses: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> We hypothesize that the tempo of a song directly impacts song popularity, especially as songs over decades begin to have different combinations of musical qualities. </li>
    <li> We hypothesize that the characteristics of music have changed over time because of the increased popularity in genres. For example, a genre like EDM that may emphasize danceability and energy over instrumentalness and Acousticness. </li>
    <li> We hypothesize that with the rise of streaming music that makes more music more widely accessible, songs will rotate through the Number 1 Spot more frequently </li>
    <li> We hypothesize that songs from different decades will most likely surround similar universal topics (for example, love) </li>
    <li> We hypothesize that top songs have begun to emerge from non-eurocentric regions as the world begins to embrace international talent </li>
  </ul>

<h2> Visualizations </h2>
<p> We will be implementing 4 main visualization idioms to help our users follow along in our data exploration and come to their own conclusions about our hypotheses</p>
<ol>
  <li> Racing Bar Charts - See how songs from 2017-2020 rotate through Spotify's top 200 charts </li>
  <li> Musical Feature Maps - See what kinds of musical features are in parts of time and what the definitions of musical features are </li>
  <li> Map of Top Songs - See how top song popularity spreads globally </li>
  <li> Bar Charts/Line Graphs of Musicality - See how songs change through the years </li>
</ol>

<h2> Data </h2>
<p> Our Data was combined from a variety of sources including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Top 200 Charted Songs Globally and across 70 countries was scraped from <a href="https://spotifycharts.com/regional">Spotifycharts.com</a>(Code located in the resources folder)</li>
  <li>Corresponding song lyrics from all the top 200 global songs were obtained using the <a href ="https://docs.genius.com/">Genius API</a> (Code located in the resources folder); lyric data missing from 154/3424 top songs</li>
  <li>Dataset of musicality obtained from Kaggle (Data stored in Spotify folder)</li>
  <li>Dataset of spotify music from Kaggle (Data stored in Spotify folder)</li>
</ul>
