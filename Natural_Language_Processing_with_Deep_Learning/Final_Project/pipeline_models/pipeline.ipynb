    "1. Problem: Bert max token length is 512. As such, our aggregate summaries can grow to be too long in the recurrent and stacked pipelines. Idea: To combat this what if we further reduce the \n",
    "   dimensionality of the resulting summary prior to the final iteration by using the nltk POS parser to filter out tokens that are not nouns, verbs, etc. The idea being\n",
    "   that tokens of certain parts of speech contain enough of the semantic meaning to not reduce the quality of the final summary, while keeping the dimensionality of\n",
    "   the intermediate summaries minimal.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Problem: Not enough of the information from previous iterations of the pipeline is retained accross iterations. This is because there is no memory of previous\n",
    "   summaries in the baseline pipeline model. Idea: To use an idea similar to the intuition behind a recurrent layer. At each iteartion, we will concatenate the previous \n",
    "   summary with the aggregate documents that are about to be summarized. The idea being that by including the summary from the previous iteration at each time step,\n",
    "   we may be able to persist information accross iterations. I speculate that this may even improve summary quality, by offering an opportunity to correct semantic\n",
    "   hallucinations at iterative step. (ATTEMPTED AND OPERATIONAL)\n",
