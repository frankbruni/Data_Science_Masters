    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "KNN does not work well since it finds the K nearest matches in the training data. But in this problem we need to use all the examples that relate to each topic so we can get as much information about individual words as possible. KNN in this example wastes a lot of information. Also a euclidean distance does not make sense here.\n",

    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",

    "ANSWER: TF-IDF is an abbreviation for Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency. In TfidfVectorizer we consider overall document weight of a word. It helps us in dealing with most frequent words. I think of it as almost a normalizing process. Using it we can penalize frequent words. TfidfVectorizer weights the word counts by a measure of how often they appear in the documents.\n",

    "TF-IDF in the examples above puts too much value on words like ftp, internet, online even though mormon is also a word and should dominate the others. Training on more data will help this mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "An R ratio of 1 means that it is most likely to predict the correct label since our highest predicted probability is the same as the correct label probability. This is valuable information and the R ratio helps us understand the type of mistake we are making. If we get a predicted probability of the correct label really small and a large probability on another label our R ratio is really large (this is what happens in our printed examples). The R ratio can never be below 1 so we can gain information by seeing how much bigger than 1 the R ratio is."
